# K-Means
Machine learning algorithm implementation 

The algorthm works as it follows:
  
  -the centroids are randomly generating, acording to given instances of training ( only first iteration ) 
  
  -the centroid is relocated in the middle of the cluster
  
  -the clusters are computed as the new iteration begins
  
  -distance matrix is computed
  
  -the nearest cluster is chosen using euclidian distance
